When I built my first website, it was for my college radio show. A simple html site that featured a flash mp3 player
and a few links to my social media. I was proud of it, and while the technology has changed - rip flash - the main
idea has stayed the same. I want to share my work with the world.

## Content Management

I've always been a fan of static sites. I like the idea of a site that is built without the need for a server. My web
development journey has taken me through many ways of managing content. Most have been some flavor of Wordpress. Now
I'm using MDX to manage my content. I can write in markdown and use JSX.
